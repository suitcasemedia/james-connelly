### What is it?

This is a painting project I did with my friend Oliver back in 2013. 
It was an <a href="http://www.transitiongallery.co.uk/htmlpages/Superpaintings.html">exhibition at Transition Gallery</a>
It would be great to continue this project with tools that are now available such as Apple's AR kit.
