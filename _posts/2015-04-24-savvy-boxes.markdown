This is a quick SVG demo of an idea I had for a company that enables companies to give 10's of thousands or more of their employees a safer way to browse the internet using  ground breaking  new hardware and software.
Each of the  numbered boxes represents a mini computer that  a customer would remotely use when browsing the internet on their personal or office devices.  There are 280 mini boxes in the demo. A collection of 280  mini devices represents the contents of a larger  box that is managed in a remote data centre. These larger boxes would be kept in racks much like you would expect servers to be stored.  A typical customer company would have 100's of these larger boxes in data centres  to cater for example 20,000 of their employees devices. Of course this  is a the  demo of  a detail page of one box but there would also need to be listing pages for all the larger boxes that the company manages.


### How it would work.
There are no images in this demo. It is all generated using Snapsvg, a javaScript library for generating and manipulting SVG. Clicking on a box allows you to zoom in on that box and edit its configuration.
The point of generating the SVG from javaScript is that can easily be generated a component in React or Angular or whatever framework you are using. This of course means that it can be generated using data from a remote API and actions from the user interacting with the SVG can easily be sent back to the server to update the system.
