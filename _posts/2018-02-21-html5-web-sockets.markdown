### Using https://www.websocket.org/echo.html
https://www.websocket.org/echo.html is a brilliant place to start for learning how to use html5 websockets.
It gives you an Echo Server at ws://demos.kaazing.com/echo. It also shows you how to set up connection to the Echo Server using html5 web sockets and send messages  to it and receive messages from it.

I built this simple web page to demonstrate the websockets in action using React.
If you type a message in the coaches phone it gets sent to the Echo Server  at  ws://demos.kaazing.com/echo and the Echo Server  sends the message to the athletes phone.

I drew the coach and athlete SVG's using inkscape.
The phones are coded in pure CSS.
Credit for the CSS for the iphone goes to this pen https://codepen.io/havardob/pen/KzoOMB
